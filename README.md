## To run the game:

1. Open the group-434 directory in a terminal window.
2. Connect two UCFunkits to your machine.
3. Run the command 'make program' twice.
4. When ready, press button 1 (on the west side of the micro-controller).
5. Once both players press button 1, the game will start.

## How to play:

The objective of this game is for two people to simply count through the alphabet
and be the first person to land on the letter Z. You can increase by up
to four letters at a time, and you have to go up at least one. Press the
navswitch up or down to select which character to count up to.

The first person to win three rounds wins the game, and with be see
a winners message. The loser will be informed that maybe it's time to
re-evalute their life choices.

We hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed coding it!
